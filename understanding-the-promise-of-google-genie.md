The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, and one particularly exciting development is the emergence of world models. These powerful AI systems are starting to transform the way we interact with computers and digital environments. Google's Genie is one such model, poised to usher in a new wave of user experiences with its interactive capabilities and potential use within a "foundational interactive environment."

### What are World Models?
World model is a term typically used to describe the internal representations a machine learning system forms during training to be able to serve the purpose it is trained for. A foundational models like large language models (LLMs) are thought to have a rich understanding of the world as learned from diverse datasets they are trained on doing justice to the term "world model".

The term is now more popularly being used to describe machine learning systems that simulate the natural world in some way and allows for ways to interact with it and use it in a specific way. These can alternatively be thought of as simulations environments. Openai's Sora, for example, allows for users to generate videos from text prompts. Google's genie and Nvidia Omniverse are other popular example systems that are often called "world models".

### Interfaces and abstractions for world models
A typical software system can be represented simply with the below diagram where a user interacts with a software by making requests to it APIs. A machine learning system is similar in that, it allows for user to make a request to it via APIs and get a response.

The API or interface defines the way a user can interact with the system. For example, a user that wants to edit an image will have very different experiences on MS Paint and Photoshop. 

### OpenAI's Sora: Generating Videos from Text
OpenAI's [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) is a cutting-edge AI model capable of generating videos from simple text prompts. The remarkable quality of the videos generated by Sora demonstrates its understanding of the physical world and is [seen by openai](https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators) as a promising path towards general purpose world simulators.

While the videos generated by Sora seems impressive and realistic, it is still limited in how one can interact with it as it only allows for a text prompt as input. A game developer or a creator would desire more ways to interact with the system to be able to accomplish their goals. Popular softwares currently used for the purpose, including Blender or Unity allow for far more flexibility as evident from their [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html). While it takes a lot of effort to create content with these softwares, since each of the building blocks is to be defined by the creators to some extent, the creators can utilize the flexibility that they get as a tradeoff. To allow for adoption in more real world applications, we can expect openai to be looking for ways to allow more interfaces for their model to meet these needs.

**Training world models**
The training of such models like Sora involves large-scale datasets of images, videos, and text descriptions. Building these environments that allows for more ways to interact with it, needs more sophisticated training data in form of text data associated with each API endpoint mapped to a corresponding change in output. The models then learn the relationships between visual concepts and linguistic descriptions. This learning process empowers the model to translate text into visual representations, effectively generating videos.

While this accomplishes the goal for more flexible world models, the system has two critical issues that need to be addressed:
1. Data generation for changes in API as requirements change remains a challenge for developer teams.
2. The system is a black box and reliable change is not always possible.

### Google Genie: Interacting Without Action Labels
[Genie](https://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/) is a foundational world model introduced by Google that goes a step beyond Sora, and allows users to generate a variety of playable worlds from images. This can be seen as a simulation being created from a set of images similar to Sora, but with an additional feature of taking input from a user playing the game. It solves the above mentioned challenges by training the model without the need for pre-defined "action labels." As earlier discussed, these labels are required to train AI models to perform specific tasks. Genie's ability to bypass this requirement is a significant breakthrough. It demonstrates AI's increasing adaptability to natural patterns of interaction.

Having such capabilities for creating simulation environments, would allow for creation of models on greater adaptability, larger scale and much diverse use cases, some examples being:
1. Environments for video game creators
2. Simulations for scientific research
3. Content creation

### Conclusion
Google Genie hints at a future where we can interact with generative worlds without explicitly having to train them on specific actions. This new generation of world models allows us to develop foundational world models that allow for more ways to interact with it. The applications for such models are vast â€“ revolutionizing industries from entertainment and education to scientific research and software development.
